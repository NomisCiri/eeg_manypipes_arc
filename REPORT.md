# Hypothesis 1

> There is an effect of scene category
> (i.e., a difference between images showing man-made vs. natural environments)
> on the amplitude of the N1 component,
> i.e. the first major negative EEG voltage deflection.

Yes.

# Hypothesis 2

> There are effects of image novelty
> (i.e., between images shown for the first time/new vs. repeated/old images)
> within the time-range from 300â€“500 ms ...
>
> a. ... on EEG voltage at fronto-central channels.
> b. ... on theta power at fronto-central channels.
> c. ... on alpha power at posterior channels.

Maybe?

# Hypothesis 3

> There are effects of successful recognition of old images
> (i.e., a difference between old images correctly recognized as old [hits] vs.
> old images incorrectly judged as new [misses]) ...
>
> a. ... on EEG voltage at any channels, at any time.
> b. ... on spectral power, at any frequencies, at any channels, at any time.

Maybe?

# Hypothesis 4

> There are effects of subsequent memory
> (i.e., a difference between images that will be successfully remembered vs.
> forgotten on a subsequent repetition) ...
>
> a. ... on EEG voltage at any channels, at any time.
> b. ... on spectral power, at any frequencies, at any channels, at any time.

Maybe?
