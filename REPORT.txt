Hypothesis 1: There is an effect of scene category (i.e., a difference between images showing man-made vs. natural environments) on the amplitude of the N1 component, i.e. the first major negative EEG voltage deflection.

Yes, there is an effect of scene category. We performed a cluster-based permutation test from -100 ms to 200 ms and over 39 frontal to parietal channels, excluding temporal and occipital channels (see supplemental material for exact channels used). The interval from -100ms to 0ms served for baseline correction of epochs. The sub-selection of channels and time was informed by previous literature on the N1 component (e.g., Luck 2014) and by inspecting grand average topography plots. The cluster-based permutation procedure was performed over the difference between ERPs of conditions “man-made” versus “natural” environments, using a one-sample t-test against zero with a two-tailed p=0.001 as the cluster-defining threshold and 10000 permutations. This resulted in three clusters significant at the conventional two-tailed threshold of p=0.05. We thus conclude that there is a significant effect of scene category. In the following, we describe the three observed clusters: (i) The first observed cluster extended from approximately 80ms to 100ms over a group of five central channels with p=0.0147, and (ii) The second observed cluster extended from approximately 120ms to 200ms over a group of twenty-two frontal channels with p=0.0001, (iii) Finally, the third observed cluster extended from approximately 120ms to 200ms over a group of 16 centro-parietal channels with p=0.0001.

Hypothesis 2a: There are effects of image novelty (i.e. between images shown for the first time/new vs. repeated/old images) within the time-range from 300–500 ms on EEG voltage at fronto-central channels.

We confirm this hypothesis. We considered frontocentral channels: FC3, FC4, Fz, FC1, FC2. The interval from -200ms to 0ms around stimulus onset served for baseline correction. After baseline correction, we cropped the data to the interval of 300-500ms after stimulus presentation. Then, we performed a cluster-based permutation test on the within-subject difference in voltage between the conditions “new” versus “old” images, using a one-sample t-test against zero with a two-tailed p=0.001 as the cluster-defining threshold and 5000 permutations. This resulted in a significant cluster at the two-tailed threshold of p=0.05. The cluster extended over the whole period tested over a group of four adjacent frontocentral channels with p=0.0002. Therefore, we conclude an effect of image novelty within the time range of 300-500 ms in the voltage at frontocentral channels.

Hypothesis 2b: There are effects of image novelty (i.e. between images shown for the first time/new vs. repeated/old images) within the time-range from 300–500 ms on theta power at fronto-central channels.

We confirm this hypothesis. Time-frequency representations for each event were computed using complex morlet wavelets with seven cycles over the frequencies between 4 and 8 Hz with increments of 0.5. We considered frontocentral channels: FC3, FC4, Fz, FC1, FC2. The interval from -200ms to -100ms around stimulus onset served for baseline correction after time-frequency decomposition. Following baseline correction, we cropped the data to the interval of 300-500ms after stimulus presentation. Then, we performed a cluster-based permutation test on the within-subject difference in time-frequency power between the conditions “new” versus “old” images, using a one-sample t-test against zero with a two-tailed p=0.001 as the cluster-defining threshold and 5000 permutations. This resulted in a significant cluster at the two-tailed threshold of p=0.05. The cluster extended from 417 to 500ms tested between 4 and 5 Hz over a group of two adjacent frontocentral channels with p=0.008. Therefore, we conclude an effect of image novelty within the time range of 300-500 ms in theta power at frontocentral channels.

Hypothesis 2c: There are effects of image novelty (i.e. between images shown for the first time/new vs. repeated/old images) within the time-range from 300–500 ms on alpha power at posterior channels.

We do not confirm this hypothesis. Time-frequency representations for each event were computed using complex morlet wavelets with seven cycles over the frequencies between 8 and 12 Hz with increments of 0.5. We considered posterior channels: POz, PO3, PO4, Oz, O1, O2, PO7 and PO8. The interval from -200ms to -100ms around stimulus onset served for baseline correction after time-frequency decomposition. Following baseline correction, we cropped the data to the interval of 300-500ms after stimulus presentation. Then, we performed a cluster-based permutation test on the within-subject difference in time-frequency power between the conditions “new” versus “old” images, using a one-sample t-test against zero with a two-tailed p=0.001 as the cluster-defining threshold and 5000 permutations. We found no clusters significant at the two-tailed threshold of p=0.05. We, therefore, conclude that there was no effect of image novelty within the time range of 300-500 ms in the alpha band at posterior channels.

Hypothesis 3a: There are effects of successful recognition of old images (i.e., a difference between old images correctly recognized as old [hits] vs. old images incorrectly judged as new [misses]) on EEG voltage at any channels, at any time.

We confirm this hypothesis. We considered all channels excluding M1, M2, Afp9, Afp9 and Iz  for this hypothesis. We cropped the preprocessed epochs to the interval of -200-1500ms around stimulus presentation. Then we applied a baseline correction on the interval from -200ms to 0ms around stimulus onset. Then, considering all time points, we performed a cluster-based permutation test on the within-subject difference in voltage between “hits” versus “misses” images, using a one-sample t-test against zero with a two-tailed p=0.001 as the cluster-defining threshold and 5000 permutations. We found six clusters, significant at the conventional two-tailed threshold of p=0.05.
In what follows, we describe the six clusters in more detail. The first observed cluster extended from 190ms to 255ms over a group of nine frontal channels with p=0.0182. The second cluster extended from 360ms to 1500ms over frontocentral channels with p=0.002. The third cluster extended from 185ms to 238ms over occipital channels with p=0.013. The fourth cluster extended from 375 ms to 621, over temporo-occipital channels with p=0.004. The fifth cluster extended from 777ms to 962ms on channel P10 with p=0.028. The sixth cluster extended from 1080ms to 1500 ms on channel AF7, p=0.004. We, therefore, conclude that there was a significant effect of successful recognition on the EEG voltage at any channel, at any time.

Hypothesis 3b: There are effects of successful recognition of old images (i.e., a difference between old images correctly recognized as old [hits] vs. old images incorrectly judged as new [misses]) on spectral power, at any frequencies, at any channels, at any time.

We confirm this hypothesis. We considered all channels, excluding M1, M2, Afp9, Afp9 and Iz, and frequencies between 4 and 100 Hz. We performed time-frequency decomposition using complex morlet wavelets with different number of cycles per frequency. We defined the number of cycles by dividing the respective frequency by two. Then we cropped the resulting data to the interval of -200 to 1500ms around stimulus onset. After time-frequency decomposition, we applied a baseline correction on the interval between -200ms to -100ms around stimulus onset. Then, we performed a cluster-based permutation test on the within-subject difference in power between “hits” versus “misses”, using a one-sample t-test against zero with a two-tailed p=0.001 as the cluster-defining threshold and 5000 permutations on all time points. We found five clusters, significant at the conventional two-tailed threshold of p=0.05.
In what follows, we describe the five clusters in more detail. The first observed cluster extended from 1009ms - 1500ms in the alpha and lower beta band (frequencies:8-18hz), on primarily posterior channels with p=0.0002. The second cluster extended from 1367ms - 1455ms at 11hz, on channels FC4 and Cz p=0.024. The third cluster extended from 1005ms - 1500ms in the theta band (4hz-6hz) on frontocentral channels with p=0.0002. The fourth cluster extended from 955ms to 1046ms in the theta band (4hz and 5hz) on channel Oz with p=0.0268. The fifth cluster extended from 1367ms - 1455ms in the theta band (5hz), on (fronto)central channels Fz and FCz p=0.0316. We, therefore, conclude that there was a significant effect of successful recognition on the spectral power at any channel, at any time, at any frequency.

Hypothesis 4a: There are effects of subsequent memory (i.e., a difference between images that will be successfully remembered vs. forgotten on a subsequent repetition) on EEG voltage at any channels, at any time.

We confirm this hypothesis. We considered all channels excluding M1, M2, Afp9, Afp9 and Iz  for this hypothesis. We cropped the preprocessed epochs to the interval of -200-1500ms around stimulus presentation. Then we applied a baseline correction on the interval from -200ms to 0ms around stimulus onset. Then, considering all time points left, we performed a cluster-based permutation test on the within-subject difference in voltage between “subsequently remembered” versus “subsequently forgotten” images, using a one-sample t-test against zero with a two-tailed p=0.001 as the cluster-defining threshold and 5000 permutations. We found seven significant at the conventional two-tailed threshold of p=0.05.
In what follows, we describe the seven clusters in more detail. The first observed cluster extended from approximately 175ms to 203ms over a group of seven posterior channels with p=0.0212. The second cluster extended from 365ms to 433ms over channels P10, PO8 and O2 with p=0.019. The third cluster extended from 445ms to 859ms over ten occipital channels with p=0.0002. The fourth cluster extended from 178 ms to 203, spaning five frontal channels with p=0.0322. The fifth cluster extended from 447ms to 513ms on nine frontocentral channels with p=0.0062. The sixth cluster spanned 566 to 623 ms on channels ​​C1, C3 and CP3, p=0.026. The seventh cluster spanned 570 to 958 ms on six frontocentral channels ​ p=0.0014.  We, therefore, conclude that there was a significant effect of successful recognition on the EEG voltage at any channel, at any time.

We found five clusters, significant at the conventional two-tailed threshold of p=0.05.
We found no cluster significant at the conventional two-tailed threshold of p=0.05.
